The [race] System
The year is 1337...
As the High Council end their search upon the desiccated surface of P3X-888, they find themselves unable to locate even the remotest trace of their eternal enemy Egeria and her nefarious brood of Tok'ra. 
Finding themselves seemingly the sole inhabitants of a planet otherwise entirely devoid of life, a soft voice inside the minds of all [race] drives them to now leave their homeworld to locate their foes and terminate them with extreme prejudice. 
In the hopes of dealing a devastating first strike to the children of Egeria, the [race] rush to develop the technology that will enable them to traverse the infinite Sea of Worlds before their enemies can achieve a similar technological prowess. The [race] do not questions the curious fact that they encounter no technological holes or roadblocks.
You, the reigning System Lord, have galvanized the [race] from all walks of life on this noble crusade against a faceless nemesis, and prepared every facet of the High Council to do whatever it takes to expunge the threat of the Tok'ra once and for all.
