The [race] Conglomerate
The year is 888...
The Conglomerate has just concluded its 88-year long extravagant feast. After the discovery of a Rich mineral mine on the home planet, neohumanity has bought off all of their many problems. The following celebration has continued non-stop like it's 999.
Before the greatest minds in science, government, military, and every other field could come down from their high, the idea of "dude, what if like, we could like, be higher than the stars bruh..." took root in the collective consciousness.
The party continues in Space!
