The [race] Development
The year is 888...
Centuries of isolationistic practice have at last been shattered by optimization breakthroughs in spatial engineering. The Neohumanity Architectural Development has unified their people and combined the societal design of art, science, and technology.
Neohumanity's short stature is believed to have evolved due to the influence of various compounds prevalent in the Rich deposits of minerals running through their homeworld mantle.
The Development has made unusual trade-offs to favor space ship space over armor, but they are fully confident that it'll accomplish their blueprint design to re-organize the galaxy.
